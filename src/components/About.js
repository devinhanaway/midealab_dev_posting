          <h1 className="col-md-12">My Story</h1>
        <ul className="text-primary">My life has been a journey driven by experiences; seeking to learn and engage with the world around me. From a young age I was curious, I got hurt a lot and I asked a lot of questions, some times when not appropriate, but it is this thirst for understanding the world around me that drive who I am today. I have worked in 3 different countries, visited over 30 and driven from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean and back. I seek experiences and perspective so that I can better understand myself, and better understand the all Humans in this world we share.</ul>

    <ul className="text-primary">I attended UNC Chapel Hill for Undergraduate, studying business with a focus in entrepreneurship, technology and healthcare. After a freshman year of Premed courses and Business pre-requisites, I spent the summer as a project manager working for a entrepreneur who ran a health clinic/software company out of Copenhagen. During this time I also started my first software company, Inverge, which I built out over the course of my sophomore year of college.</ul>

    <ul className="text-primary">These two experiences drove my decision to let go of my medical school aspiration; realizing that I wanted to bring a about change to more than just medicine, and that I did not have to be a medical doctor to impact the healthcare industry. I spent my sophomore year dedicated to learning how to pitch, grow, and develop both a business idea, and software product, while also taking 18 hours of credit, and starting Carolina Think, UNCâ€™s Entrepreneurship Club.</ul>

    <ul className="text-primary">The following summer I received an Innovation Fellowship to immerse myself in the Silicon Valley Startup Community, working for Galvanize as an Intern and connecting with many Bay Area thought leaders and companies. My time at Galvanize, and in the Bay Area, along with my developing understanding of building software and managing engineers, made me realize that in order to bring about the change I want to create, that I needed to learn software engineering.
    </ul>
    <ul className="text-primary">I came back to UNC after my sophomore year, and decided that rather than switching my major to Computer Science, that I would take 50 hours my senior year, graduate a year early and use the last year of my college fund for a Full Stack Web Development Immersive.

    The following July, I found myself submitting my final paper in college from the barracks of an overnight train through Croatia. I had to take 9 hours over the summer to pull off the 50 hours, but managed to find a way to complete this while vagabonding and doing a work-trade on a sailboat throughout Europe.

    After returning to the states in the Fall of 2016, applied to and got accepted to the Galvanize Full Stack Web Development Immersive in Denver, Colorado. I moved out to Denver, in December, and on Feb, 14th, I started the 6 month journey to learning how to be a software developer, and to be a more effective Product Manager, and Entrepreneur.
